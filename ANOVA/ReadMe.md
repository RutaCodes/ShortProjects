# What is ANOVA?

**ANOVA**, or *Analysis of Variance*, is a test used to determine differences between research results from multiple samples or groups.

The idea behind the **ANOVA** test: if the average variation between groups is large enough compared to the average variation within groups, then you can conclude that at least one group mean is not equal to the others. To analyze that we evaluate whether the differences between the group means are significant by comparing the two variance estimates. 

The *assumptions* of the **ANOVA** test:
- *Independence of observations*: There are no hidden relationships among observations.
- *Normally-distributed response variable*: The values of the dependent variable follow a normal distribution.
- *Homogeneity of variance*: The variation within each group being compared is similar for every group.

# One-way ANOVA

**One-way ANOVA** test is used when the data are organized into several groups according to only one single grouping variable.
# Two-way ANOVA

**Two-way ANOVA** is used to simultaneously evaluate the effect of two different grouping variables on a continuous outcome variable.
