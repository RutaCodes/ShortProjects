# What is ANOVA?

ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a test used to determine differences between research results from multiple samples or groups.

The idea behind the ANOVA test: if the average variation between groups is large enough compared to the average variation within groups, 
then you can conclude that at least one group mean is not equal to the others. To analyze that we evaluate whether the differences between 
the group means are significant by comparing the two variance estimates. 

# One-way ANOVA

One-way ANOVA test is used when the data are organized into several groups according to only one single grouping variable (e.g. test group).

# Two-way ANOVA

Two-way ANOVA is used to simultaneously evaluate the effect of two different grouping variables on a continuous outcome variable.
