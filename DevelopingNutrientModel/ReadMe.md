# Developing Multiple Linear Regression Model to Predict Nutrient Concentrations

The goal of this project was to analyze how water quality differs across sites in California and Neveda. 

In this folder, you will find these files:
1) *ProjectScope.md*  -  Description of the project, goals, study area, methods, and modeling workflow. 
2) MAIN CODE - *OLS_modeling_fieldC.R*  -  Code that was used to analyze results and develop predictive linear models for analyzed compounds.
   This code imports data from two csv files:
      - *Land_cover_data.csv*  -  Land cover information
      - *Analyte_conc.csv*  -  Measured nutrient concetrations
