# Research Interest

Increased nutrient concentrations in surface water are often associated with decreased water quality. In this project relationship between land cover and observed nutrient (i.e. phosphorus, potassium, ammonia, fluoride, chloride, nitrate, sulphate) concentrations were studied. 

# Sources of Nutrients

Nutrients can enter the system from various artificial and natural sources. Aftificial sources are often associated with agriculture, urbanization and other human related activities.

Some examples of natural and artificial nutrient sources by analyte:

It is important to consider both sources to fully understand nutrient dynamics in study watersheds.

# Study Sites

Water samples were taken in multiple locations across California and Nevada.

All selected study locations had varying levels of urban and agricultural activity, which was perfect for studying relationship between land cover and detected nutrient concentrations. 

# Results

Ion Chromatography (IC) was used to process samples and measure nutrient concentrations. IC results showed a wide range of concentrations:

# Correlations 

First, correlation analysis was performed to determine similarities among nutrient occurance. Spearman correlation coefficeint was calculated to quantify co-occurance patterns among compounds:

Similarly, land cover similarities among sites were analyzed:

These correlations analysis results allow to easily identify similar land use watersheds, which can be used to help predict nutrient concentrations. It would be expected that sites that are primarily forested with minimal urbanization would have lower nutrient concentration, while watersheds with high cultivated crop and urban cover would have higher nutrient concentrations.

Finally, correlation between land use and different nutrients was analyzed:

Results show that most of the studied compounds have relatively strong negative correlation with forested landcover (no agricultural or urban activity). On the other hand, ammonia, chloride, nitrate, and sulphate are strongly positively correlated with urban (i.e. developed) and agricultural (i.e. cultivated crops, hay/pasture, etc.) land covers. This signifies that these four compounds are likely entering the surface water from artificial sources, hence we see an increase in their concentrations when large portion of the watershed is affected by human activity. 

# Modeling



Results from correlation analysis were then used to inform which land cover types should be used as explanatory variables in the model.
