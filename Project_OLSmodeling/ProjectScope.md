# Research Interest

Incresed nutrient concentrations in surface waters are often associated with decreased water quality. In this project relationship between land cover and observed nutrient (i.e. phosphorus, potassium, ammonia, fluoride, chloride, nitrate, sulphate) concentrations were studied.

# Sources of Nutrients

Nutrients can come from natural as well as artificial inputs. It is important to consider both sources to fully understand nutrient dynamics in study watersheds.

Include most of the presentation:
1) research questions
2) background on nutrients and their sources
3) sampling strategy
4) concentrations
5) explain what I modeled, what I used as explanatory variables and what were the results, what was the accuracy

Include modeling code with good comments
