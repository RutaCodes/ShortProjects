Regression Analysis (APM 630) is a graduate level course in Applied Regression Analysis that was being taught by Dr. Lianjun Zhang in the Department of Applied Mathematics at SUNY ESF. It is designed to teach students how to develop simple linear models, multiple linear models, nonlinear regression models, and linear mixed models using Statistical Analysis System (SAS). The primary emphases are on the methods and applications of regression techniques. Lectures covered necessary theory, criteria and strategies for selecting "best" models, detecting flaws of the models, and improving model fitting and performance. Examples in forestry, biology and social sciences were used to illustrate the applications of the techniques.
